## Why a todo system?

Keep on asking why until we get to the root of the matter

- I want to get stuff done
- if I don't get stuff done then I'll die
- Because the bills would not get payed

Do we need a system just to pay the bills and survive

- No, I want to get things done that move me towards my goals

### Goals

Life goals

Work goals

micro goals

### tracking progress

metrics

When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure -  Charles Goodhart

when a feature of the economy is picked as an indicator of the economy, then it inexorably ceases to function as that indicator because people start to game it - Charles Goodhart

- velocity (story points averages per sprint)
- pomodoros completed on average per week
- number of items completed on average per week
- lines of code written
- Tickets completed
- emotional state and the end of each day

Keep emotion out of the measurements, its really only to help in the retro to see if a change to the system had an effect
